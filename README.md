# Java Tool Kit

This repository is a growing collection of code which provides functionalities that are commonly involved in Java web development. The original intention to establish this collection is to avoid the circumstances where I need to re-invent the wheel repeatedly. So whenever a similar functionality is required during web development process, I can simply turn to this collection to check if there is a piece of code that can be reused, if not, a new piece of code is put into this collection for future reference. This way, the user of this collection can increase efficiency of Java web development.

Note that this repository is by no means a complete and thoroughly-tested library. The sole purpose is to provide a rudimentary tool kit that user can look for code to be a good starting point.
